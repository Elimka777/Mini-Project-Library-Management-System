# Mini-Project: Library Management System

Student: Elima

I utilized Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Python to create a sophisticated Library Management System. This command-line application is crafted to simplify the management of books and resources within a library. It enables users to browse, borrow, return, and explore a collection of books, showcasing proficiency in OOP principles and the use of modules.

â€¢Running the Application:

1)Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd path/to/LibraryManagementSystem

2)Run the Application:

main.py
